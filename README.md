College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study 
This assignment successfully demonstrated the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing Yelp reviews using various tools and techniques. By utilizing the Yelp API, we gathered valuable customer feedback for businesses located in Jersey City, NJ. Sentiment analysis was performed using both TextBlob and NaiveBayesAnalyzer to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative, offering insights into customer perceptions. The reviews were further refined by removing stop words using the NLTK library, improving the quality of analysis. Data visualization, including donut charts and word clouds, helped to represent sentiment distributions and the most frequently used words in the reviews. This project provided a comprehensive understanding of how data analysis, text processing, and visualization can be integrated to gain meaningful insights from customer reviews, which can be useful for business strategy, customer experience improvements, and marketing decisions
